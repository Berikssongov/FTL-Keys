- Define a restricted key and create rules on it's logic
  - (/^[A-F]\d{1,2}$/i test.name)
  - Can never have more than one instance in existance
 - Define Non-restricted keys and set rules
 - Debug page for easier debugging
- Working on checking if the key is in the lockbox, and if not returning an error, but if so then transfering the first instance ( Done)
